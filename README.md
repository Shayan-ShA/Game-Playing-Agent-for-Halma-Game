# Game-Playing-Agent-for-Halma-Game

Project description
In this project, we will play the game of Halma, an adversarial game with some similarities to
checkers. The game uses a 16x16 checkered gameboard. Each player starts with 19 game pieces
clustered in diagonally opposite corners of the board. To win the game, a player needs to
transfer all of their pieces from their starting corner to the opposite corner, into the positions
that were initially occupied by the opponent. Note that this original rule of the game is subject
to spoiling, as a player may choose to not move some pieces at all, thereby preventing the
opponent from occupying those locations. Note that the spoiling player cannot win either
(because some pieces remain in their original corner and thus cannot be used to occupy all
positions in the opposite corner). Here, to prevent spoiling, we modify the goal of the game to
be to occupy all of the opponent’s starting positions which the opponent is not still occupying.

modification.
